I use logseq for my daily note-taking (and [for my work](https://www.dannygarside.co.uk/blog/An-open-source-knowledge-management-system-for-the-lab/)!) and I have a template which I have honed over the years. It will continue to evolve, but here's what it looks like right now.

```
- Daily template
  template:: Daily Template
  template-including-parent:: false
	- Prepare
		- What's the energy?
		- Diary commitments:
			-
		- Primary goal
			-
		- Secondary goals
			-
		- Bonus goals
			-
		- **I'm grateful for...**
		- **I'm looking forward to** ...
	- The day's notes
	- Reflect
		- Highlights
			-
		- **I was at my best when** ...
		- **I felt unrest when** ...
		- **Today I learnt** ...
		- **One way I can improve tomorrow:** ...
		- **Tomorrow I will** ...
	- Interesting distractions
